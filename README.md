# You Deserve a Flower 🌸

A full-stack Web3 NFT dApp that gifts unique flower NFTs to users on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## Overview

This project allows users to receive beautiful, randomly-selected flower NFTs completely free. Each user can only mint one NFT per wallet to keep the experience special and fair.

Built with modern Web3 technologies, the dApp features automated owner-signed transactions for gasless user experience, IPFS/Pinata integration for decentralized metadata storage, and a polished React frontend with smooth animations.

**Note:** This is not the complete version of the project. I am currently developing additional features and improvements.
